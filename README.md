# blindness_detection

### This is a project that I worked on for my master's in data science. 

### I wanted to compare the accuracy of a model built from scratch to a model where 
### I incorporated transfer learning using VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception pretrained models. 

### I love playing with data, and I would be very interested to hear what others think. Maybe
### there are ways to enhance this model??? I'm very open to feedback!
